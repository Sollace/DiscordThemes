# Discord Theme Fix

Since discord's design team are too busy smoking paint chips, I have no choice but to fix their mistakes.

This is a custom theme for Vencord that you can apply on top of the existing dark theme (light theme is not supported). I recommend using it with the Ash theme for the best experience, but it works just as well with Dark and Onyx.

## Changes:
 - Restored old appearance of the server list
    - Server icons are 10% larger and are round
    - The server list is distenguished from the rest of the app by a darker background

 - Adjusted contrast and perceptual depth of the UI
    - Made embeds, message action buttons, context menus all darker
    - Changed hover background for messages to a darker colour (rather than lighter)
    - Made tooltips darker
    - Changed code blocks to a neutral colour
    
 - Reducing wasted space
    - Made the text input field slightly shorter
    - Made the User account section slightly shorter, closer to what it was before
    - The user account switcher no longer overlaps the server list
    - Removed the new extra title bar

 - Misc UX improvements
    - Restored bottom of chat buffer
    - Move chat input back down
    - Move typing and cooldown indicator back to the top of the chat input
    - Reverts profile popups to their pre-2025 design
    - Removed the "Activity" tab from profiles (a neccessary loss to get tab switching working again)

## Bonus

The "Remove Junk" theme is an optional addon you can install alongside this theme. All it will do is clean up all of the adware/bloatware garbage that discord has been slowly dripping into their UI.
